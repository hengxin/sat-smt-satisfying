- [(coursera) Automated Reasoning: Satisfiability](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automated-reasoning-sat)
  > In this course you will learn how to apply satisfiability (SAT/SMT) tools to solve a wide range of problems.
  > Several basic examples are given to get the flavor of the applications: fitting rectangles to be applied for printing posters, scheduling problems, solving puzzles, and program correctness. Also underlying theory is presented: resolution as a basic approach for propositional satisfiability, the CDCL framework to scale up for big formulas, and the simplex method to deal with linear inequallities.
