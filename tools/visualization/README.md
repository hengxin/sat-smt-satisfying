    - We present an abstract and simple
      visualization of solving the SAT problem – finding an exit in a maze –
      that models many techniques of modern solvers, ranging from simple
      search over verifying unsatisfiability proofs and formula simplification to
      parallel search techniques that include sharing of knowledge.
